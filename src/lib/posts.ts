        text: 'Making cold process soap requires an exact chemical reaction between lye (sodium hydroxide) and oils. A lye calculator takes the weight of each oil in your recipe and tells you exactly how much NaOH and water you need. Get it wrong and your soap will be lye-heavy and caustic, or too soft to cure properly. A good lye calculator removes the guesswork entirely.'

        heading: 'NaOH vs KOH',
        text: 'Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is used for solid bar soap. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used for liquid soap and soft soap. Each oil has a different SAP value — the amount of lye required to fully saponify one gram of that oil. Your lye calculator uses these values automatically, so you just enter your oil weights and choose your lye type.'
